				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of an imae of a landscape</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The landscape is generated using perlin noise. I used this tutorial to build it ->(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tyhfpxwips)
					I can't explain how it work quite well, but it was fasinating to experiment with and learn about this generator.
					The linked video explains the concept very well and is a great resource on perlin noise functions in p5js
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The assignment was fun overall. The landscape didn't come out as well as I wanted it to, and I couldn't figure out how to add 3-d rocks.
					However, it was still cool to create an image using math. I always figured I would have to use the math I learned, but never quite in this way.
					It open my eyes to the possiblities of mathmatical generation
